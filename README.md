Hi there,

Welcome to the BitSell ATM software.

Please purchase a license from http://bitsellatm.com/

Please make sure your installation
is located at http://(your-site).com/bitsellatm

Please get API keys from https://www.coinpayments.net/

Please make sure your API keys from CoinPayments
have access to all permissions.

Adding currencies is simple: make sure BlueTrade and
CoinPayments both accept them since we use BlueTrade for calculation of
e.g. POT to USD then add another link on index.php

If you require any support, we're always availible- free of charge.
Just open a ticket in the client center on the BitSell website :)

Thanks,<br>
-- The BitSell Team
