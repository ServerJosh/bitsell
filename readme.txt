Hi there,

Welcome to the BitSell ATM software.

Please purchase a license from BitSellATM dot com!

Please also gain an API key from BitSellATM dot com!

Please make sure your installation is located at http://(your-site).com/bitsellatm)

Please get API keys from CoinPayments.net

Please make sure your API keys from CoinPayments.net have access to all permissions. 

Adding currencies is simple: make sure BlueTrade and CoinPayments both accept them since we use BlueTrade for calculation of e.g. POT to USD then add another link on index.php 

If you require any support, we're always availible- free of charge. Just open a ticket in the client center on the BitSell website :)

Thanks,
The BitSell Team
